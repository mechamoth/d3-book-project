# D3 Book Exercises

Just me working through the exercises in [Interactive Data Visualisation for the Web](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345) by Scott Murray.

This is me manually typing it in ("the hard way") with my own structure and "will this work?" modifications. Real example code (as provided by the author) is available from [the book's example code repo](https://github.com/alignedleft/d3-book).
